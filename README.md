# python-basics
A place where the most basic, basic of python coding exists


As you can see, there are four folders and the best order to read is:
1. [appetizer](https://github.com/AngelineJCQ/python-basics/tree/main/appetizer)
2. [list-and-dictionary](https://github.com/AngelineJCQ/python-basics/tree/main/list-and-dictionary)
3. [APIs](https://github.com/AngelineJCQ/python-basics/tree/main/APIs)
4. [jupyter-notebook-and-APIs](https://github.com/AngelineJCQ/python-basics/tree/main/jupyter-notebook-and-APIs)

Actually, these are my homework for a course called Foundation in the Data Jouranlism [@ledeprogram](https://github.com/ledeprogram). So glad to have [Jonathan Soma](https://github.com/jsoma) as my instructor who is a great, amazing coder!
