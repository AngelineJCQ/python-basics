# A little magic about the age calculation
When run from the command line, this file should prompt the user for their year of birth, and print out (approximately):
- How old the user is
- How many times the user's heart has beaten
- How many times a blue whale's heart has beaten
- How many times a rabbit's heart has 
If the answer to rabbit heartbeats is more than a million, say "XXX million" instead of the very long raw number
- How old they are in Venus years
- How old they are in Neptune years

- Whether they are the same age as you, older or younger
- If older or younger, how many years difference
- If they were born in an even or odd year

- How many times there has been a president from the Democratic Party in office since they were born (1960 onward, and each president only counts once)
- Which US President was in office when they were born (1960 onward)

If someone says they were born in the future, try asking them again (assume they'll do it right the second time).
