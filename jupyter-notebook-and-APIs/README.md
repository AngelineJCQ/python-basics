# Jupyter Notebook and APIs

 I deleted my apikey because I don't want to run out of my free trials :) You may use your own api keys.

## PART ONE: Last FM API (Music)

Using the [Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api/):

1. Search for and print a list of 50 musicians with lil in their name, along with the number of listeners they have
2. How many listeners does your list have in total?
3. Show each artist's name and the URL to the extra-large image
4. Find Lil Jon's mbid
5. Find the artist's name and bio using their mbid
6. Print every tag of that artist
7. Find and save mbids
8. Use mbids to create API urls
9. Print artists' name, tag and other informations

## PART TWO: Weather API

Using the [weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/). 

1. Make a request to the Weather API for Ningbo, a city where I was born
- learn about the wind speed / current temperature and feeling temperature
- learn about the moon-related information: how much of the moon will be visible tomorrow?
- calculate the the difference between the high and low temperatures for today
- get the daily forecasts, printing out the next three days' worth of predictions
- find out the hottest day in the next three days and its temperature

2. Make a request for the current weather in Miami, Florida
- learn about the wheather in the next 24+ hours
- calculate the percentage of the time with the temperature above 85 degrees
